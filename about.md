Graduation day with my family

Hello, I'm Casey Weed. I'm a graduate of the now extinct Armstrong State University. I work at Mailchimp (now owned by Intuit) as a Senior Data Engineer on the Search team. I spend most of my time working with the ELK stack, Python and Kubernetes.

I'm not a writer and I write how I speak, so expect my writing to be terrible unless it's technical documentation.

Here's some junk you might be interested in as well as other useless facts:

* You can email at [casey@caseyweed.com][email]
    * I don't mind job inquiries, but please don't blast me, hit me up if it's relevant.
* I put projects and snippets on my [github][git]
    * This blog is here at [{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_username }}.github.io][blog]
* My family owned (RIP) the best cat in the universe, his name is [Spooky][spooky]
* I have my own two goobers --- [(Handsome) Henry & (Wacky) Wilbur][idiots] --- they're great, mostly.
    * Wilbur unfortunately passed away March 9th, 2025. [Rest in peace, little buddy][wilbur].
* For some reason I enjoy writing technical documentation (and I hate Confluence, sorry, but it sucks)

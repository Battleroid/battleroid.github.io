![me, graduation day](/assets/self.jpg)

My name is Casey Weed. I graduated from Armstrong State University with my Bachelor's in IT and am currently employed at Mailchimp as a Data Engineer on the Search team.

Just so you know, I'm not an English major, so expect my writing to be terrible. Maybe I'll get better if I write more, who knows.

Here's some stuff junk you might be interested in and useless facts:

* You can email at [casey@caseyweed.com][email], optional pgp key [here][pgp]
* I put projects and snippets on my [github][git]
* My family owns the best cat in the universe, his name is [Spooky](/assets/spooky.jpg)
* I have my own two idiots---[Henry & Wilbur][idiots]
* For some reason I enjoy writing technical documentation (and I hate Confluence, sorry, but it sucks)

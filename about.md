Graduation day with my family

My name is Casey Weed. I graduated from Armstrong State University with my bachelor's in IT and am currently employed at Mailchimp (now owned by Intuit) as a Data Engineer on the Search team. I spend much of the day mucking with Kubernetes, the ELK stack, Python, Bash, etc.

I'm not a writer, so expect my writing to be terrible. Maybe I'll get better if I write more, who knows.

Here's some junk you might be interested in as well as other useless facts:

* You can email at [casey@caseyweed.com][email], optional pgp key [here][pgp]
    * <details>
        <summary>if you're contacting me about a job, please read this little disclaimer first</summary>
        <p>I work primarily with Elasticsearch, Python and Linux. I utilize Kubernetes, Kafka and a few other technologies and have <i>some</i> experience with GCP. I have no professional expertise with SQL, so just know if your job description contains "expert in SQL" or similar language, I'm probably going to tell you no.</p>
        <p>I'm a systems & infrastructure kind of person. I like writing scripts, tooling and generally things that have measurable impact on customers' day-to-day life (internal or external). I'm not a business intelligence or data science kind of person.</p>
        <p>That's all, thanks for reading!</p>
      </details>
* I put projects and snippets on my [github][git]
    * This blog is here at [{{ site.github_username }}/{{ site.github_username }}.github.io][blog]
* My family owned (RIP) the best cat in the universe, his name is [Spooky][spooky]
* I have my own two idiots --- [(Handsome) Henry & (Wacky) Wilbur][idiots] --- they're great, mostly.
* For some reason I enjoy writing technical documentation (and I hate Confluence, sorry, but it sucks)

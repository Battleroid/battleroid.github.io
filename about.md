Graduation day with my family

My name is Casey Weed. I graduated from Armstrong State University with my bachelor's in IT and am currently employed at Mailchimp as a Data Engineer on the Search team.

I'm not a writer, so expect my writing to be terrible. Maybe I'll get better if I write more, who knows.

Here's some stuff junk you might be interested in and other useless facts:

* You can email at [casey@caseyweed.com][email], optional pgp key [here][pgp]
* I put projects and snippets on my [github][git]
* My family owns the best cat in the universe, his name is [Spooky][spooky]
* I have my own two idiots --- [(Handsome) Henry & (Wacky) Wilbur][idiots] --- they're great, mostly.
* For some reason I enjoy writing technical documentation (and I hate Confluence, sorry, but it sucks)
